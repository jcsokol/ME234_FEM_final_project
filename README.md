# ME234_final_project
ME234 final project MATLAB code for modeling cortical folding using the finite-element method. A short video of the resulting simulations can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qfmy7yPCOE&list=PLkNjgEMAdyUMbqRxr2ZDnR0FkhNXd3bp2&index=24).

In order to run this code, add 'FEM_FOLDING_SCRIPT' and all of its subdirectories to your MATLAB path, and run 'Main_FoldingRect.m'. Be sure to adjust the modelling parameters within 'Main_FoldingRect.m'. 

An example of a resulting output is within 'RES_001'.
